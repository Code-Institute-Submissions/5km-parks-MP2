### Project Description
This project was made as part of my Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. 

As we are all well aware, lockdowns are not fun! 
With everyone spending more and more time indoors the importance of getting some fresh air has never been greater. 
I decided to create a web app which displays local open parks with a set radius of a users location. 

Users can keep within travel restrictions *(5km from your home as of 07/02/21)*. 
And discover new or forgotten green spaces with their immediate vicinity.

## Contents 



## User Experience (UX)

#### Breif 
I wanted to create an app that will provide a simple and streamlined way for users to access immediate details
on green spaces for walking within their vicinity. 
Users will liekly be keen on outdoors or walking. 
Owing to the lockdown, and people wanting to be outdoors more, we could a variety of users. 


#### The aim of this project is to:
- Be simple and easy to use.
- Visually pleasing. 
- Display a 5km radius around the user's current location on a map. 
- Plot parks within that radius. 
- Only display open parks. 
- Provide functionality for users to see route to a park they have selected. 
- Provide the user with the walking time & distance to their selected park. 
- Provide the user with a rating of their selected park. 
- Allow the user to customise their experience. 
- Provide a clear a help section.


#### Business/ Monetisation**
- Advertising would be the main monetisation route, the site has ample space for unintrusive advertising. 


#### New User Stories**
- I want the purpose to be obvious or easy to figure out
- I want to have access to the information available in as few steps of possible
- I definitely want to know the walking time and distance. 
- I want to see parks at nearer proximity. 


#### Returning & Regular User Stores**
- I want to be able to customise by experiance. 
- I want my theme settings to be rememberd for my next visit.
