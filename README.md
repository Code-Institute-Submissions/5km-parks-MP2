### Project Description
This project was made as part of the Code Institute Full Stack Development Course. 

As we are all well aware, lockdowns are not fun! 
With everyone spending more and more time indoors the importance of getting some fresh air has never been greater. 
I decided to create a web app which displays local open parks with a set radius of a users location. 

Users can keep within travel restrictions *(still 5km from your home as of 07/02/21)*. 
And discover new or forgotten green spaces within their immediate vicinity.

## Contents 



## User Experience (UX)

#### Brief 
I wanted to create an app which will provide a simple and streamlined way for users to access 
immediate details on green spaces for walking within their vicinity. 
Users will liekly be keen on outdoors or walking. 
Owing to the lockdown, and people wanting to be outdoors more, we could see a wide variety of users. 


#### The aim of this project is to:
- Be simple and easy to use.
- Visually pleasing. 
- Display a 5km radius around the user's current location on a map. 
- Plot parks within that radius. 
- Only display open parks. 
- Provide functionality for users to see the route to a park they have selected. 
- Provide the user with the walking time & distance to their selected park. 
- Provide the user with a rating of their selected park. 
- Allow the user to customise their experience. 
- Provide a clear help section.


#### Business/ Monetisation
- Advertising would be the main monetisation route, the site has ample space for unintrusive advertising. 


#### New User Stories
- I want the purpose to be obvious or easy to figure out
- I want to have access to the information available in as few steps of possible
- I definitely want to know the walking time and distance. 
- I want to see parks at a closer proximity. 


#### Returning & Regular User Stores
- I want to be able to customise by experiance. 
- I want my theme settings to be rememberd for my next visit. 



## Design (UX)

### Colours 

A simple palette of colours was chosen. 
The goal is to convey the relationship with green space. 

**Four main colours**

Green - *#3FB777*\

### Wireframes 

![Wireframes](https://github.com/asdub/5km-parks-MP2/blob/master/readme/wireframes.png "Wireframes")

Mock Ups were completed for Desktop, Tablet & mobile devices. 

Wireframes can be viewed in full resolution [here](https://xd.adobe.com/view/44519a7f-885e-48e5-988e-39706e3ca85a-1102/?fullscreen).


*Design changes during production*\
During the build of this app it became apparent that the desktop version better suited positoning of the park information card below, as with the table and mobile versions.\


### Typography

This project uses [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

Only one font is in use,\
**Roboto** in a weights of 400, 500 & 700.\

### Iconography

All icons in this project are from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).
And also via this repo [Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG](https://github.com/encharm/Font-Awesome-SVG-PNG). 
This allowed me to import the SVG's into a vector program to make custom markers while still be able to keep icon uniformity. 

*I did experiment with using SVG based markers for better quaulity - 
however that in itself persented another set of challenges (for another project!).*

The following icons have been used throughout the app,\
